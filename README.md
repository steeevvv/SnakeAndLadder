# SnakeAndLadder
Snake and Ladder Problem - Adjacency List Implementation (C++)

This was a Final Group Project for CSE 331 - Data Structures and Algorithms

It is an implementation of (template Directed Graph [GENERIC] - using Adjacency List) 


# About the Project
Given a snake and ladder board, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or last cell from source or 1st cell. Basically, the player has total control over outcome of dice throw and wants to find out minimum number of throws required to reach last cell.

A main was implemented to test the functionality of a Graph, and to test the code on two different Snake and Ladder Boards.
